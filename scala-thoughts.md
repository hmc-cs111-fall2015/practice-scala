### What's easy to do in Scala? What's not?
There are built-in functions that make pattern-matching recursion seem extraordinarily simple.
Well, I would say that it is conceptually dense, like Racket. The amount of thought that each line takes is quite a bit, though I may be biased since this is the first time I've used Scala.
I would say it is not that difficult to do anything, at least compared to other general purpose programming languages. I feel like it is powerful in what I can accomplish in a few lines of code, but at the same time has the ability to take on any task -- I can definitely notice the Java peeking through. 
It is probably difficult to do domain-specific tasks without building/importing a library that is made for those tasks.

### What is/are your favorite language design choice(s) that the designers of Scala made? Why?
My favorite language design choice is to have the type declaration after the variable name.
It feels more intuitive when I am writing out code, and it is easier for me to modify (and recycle) code. 

### What is/are your least favorite language design choice(s)? Why? And why do you think the designers made that / those choice(s)?
I very much dislike that the language will guess types if I don't declare them explicitly. I love their choice of declaring vals and vars, safety first! I feel like I will get lazy and skip out on type declarations but I think it is generally easier to read code _with_ type declarations and I don't want the language to let me get lazy.

### What Scala features would you like to learn more about?
Their documentation is quite dense, and lacking examples! I wish I knew more about the various functions that the different built-in types have since they seem to specific to data manipulations that would be tricky or costly to do by hand.

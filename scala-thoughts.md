Well, that may have been the most frustrating coding experience I've had since I learned to code. Wrestling my mind into a functional programming mode (which I haven't done in 3 semesters) was challenging in itself, but the most difficult thing about this homework was dealing with SyntaxErrors and TypeErrors. Of the ~12 hours I spent on the assignment I feel like I spent maybe 3 hours designing the actual algorithms to solve the problems. While I guess it's nice that ScalaIDE tells you about TypeErrors before compile time or even runtime, their error messages are truly obfuscating and don't point you anywhere near the right direction (which is usually that I forgot to define the return type of a function (so it defaulted to unit) or that I forgot an equals sign when defining a function).

To be fair, Scala does have some really nice things, things that I could appreciate even as I struggled through trying to make my code compile. The functional programming paradigm lets you use some nifty functions like map and reduce, which turn tasks that would take a long time in other languages into short work. On the other hand, I can recall a number of times when I wanted to solve a challenge using a quick for loop, but didn't have the tools to write one. Another nice feature of Scala is the sheer number of methods available in many of the utility classes - a single ScalaDoc often reads longer than 2 to 3 JavaDocs. 

I think my least favourite design choice that the Scala designers made is not explicitly requiring object typing. I would often be trundling along writing an intricate function, and once I tried to fit the last piece into place I'd learn that the map function doesn't return the type that I want, and I would have often have to start again from scratch. Alternatively, if they're going to go around performing type conversions while we're not looking, they should've made it easier to cast objects back to the type you need. 

In addition, many of my frustrations came from ScalaIDE and not necessarily the Scala language itself. For instance, when I tried to use ctrl-space to give me the list of methods that a particular class supports, I found the suggestion list missing out on several methods (like partition or span for lists), which I realised (on reading the solutions) would've been real helpful for some of the coding exercises. Next time I will have to make sure I have the ScalaDocs open and manually read them when I'm looking up a method.

I really hope I get better at Scala in the coming weeks, or the final project is going to be really tough. I want to learn how to debug Scala code efficiently, and how to write programs using functional programming paradigms. Hopefully practice will help.

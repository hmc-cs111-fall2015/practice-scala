  /**
   * Taken from: <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/1460488/dashboard">Problem A. Speaking in Tongues</a>
   *
   * Problem
   * The aim of this task is to translate a language into a new language called Googlerese.
   * To translate we take any message and replace each English letter with another English letter.
   * This mapping is one-to-one and onto, which means that the same input letter always gets replaced
   * with the same output letter, and different input letters always get replaced with different output letters.
   * A letter may be replaced by itself. Spaces are left as-is.
   *
   * For example (and here is a hint!), the translation algorithm includes the following three mappings:
   * 'a' -> 'y', 'o' -> 'e', and 'z' -> 'q'. This means that "a zoo" will become "y qee".
   *
   * Sample Input/Output
   * Input:
   * Case 1: ejp mysljylc kd kxveddknmc re jsicpdrysi
   * Case 2: rbcpc ypc rtcsra dkh wyfrepkym veddknkmkrkcd
   * Case 3: de kr kd eoya kw aej tysr re ujdr lkgc jv
   *
   * Output:
   * Case 1: our language is impossible to understand
   * Case 2: there are twenty six factorial possibilities
   * Case 3: so it is okay if you want to just give up
   *

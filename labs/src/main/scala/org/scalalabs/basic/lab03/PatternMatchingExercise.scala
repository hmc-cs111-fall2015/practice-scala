/**
 * This exercise introduces you to the powerful pattern matching features of Scala.
 *
 * Pattern matching can in its essence be compared to Java's 'switch' statement,
 * even though it provides many more possibilites. Whereas the Java switch statmenet
 * lets you 'match' primitive types up to int's, Scala's pattern matching goes much
 * further. Practically everything from all types of objects and Collections
 * can be matched, not forgetting xml and a special type of class called case classes.
 *
 * Pattern matching is also often used in combination with recursive algorithms.
 *
 * For this exercise exclusively use pattern matching constructs in order to make the
 * corresponding unit test work.
